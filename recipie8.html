                20 mins. Later drain the water and set aside.

                • ¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala (adjust to taste)
                • 1 teaspoon coriander powder (optional)
                • 12 to 14 cashews

                5. Saute this onion tomato masala on a low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. It should begin to smell good and aromatic. Turn off the stove.6. Cool this completely and add to a blender. Pour 1 cup water. Blend this mixture to a super smooth puree.

                • 1 bay leaf9. When the spices begin to sizzle, add 1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute for 1 minute or until you begin to smell it good. The raw smell should go away. Take care to cook this on a low to medium heat. Do not burn the paste.10. Next pour onion tomato puree. I also added ¼ teaspoon red chili powder for deeper color. This is completely optional. Ensure the stove flame is at low else the curry begins to splatter.
                11. Immediately pour ½ cup water & mix well to bring it to a gravy consistency. If it is too thick you can add little more water.12. Cover and cook on a medium flame until the gravy turns thick & flavorful.
