            <p class="pro">1. Add the chicken to a bowl along with soya sauce, salt, pepper powder and flour. Next add eff white only as needed and coat the chicken well. You can alternately skip egg and brine the chicken overnight following my tip in the recipe notes above.
                For spicier chicken you can also add little chilli paste like I did here.
                2. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a small pan. When the oil is hot enough, regulate the flame to medium. Then slide chicken pieces one after the other and fry them in batches. When the chicken turns golden & crisp, remove them to a steel colander.3. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan. Alternately remove the oil you used for deep frying to a small bowl. Turn off the stove for a minute and bring down the temperature of the oil slightly.
                4. Add the red chilies and fry for 30 seconds or until it turns crisp. Then add ginger and garlic. Saute for 1 minute.
                5. Then saute the spring onions for a minute on a high flame. Next add the sichuan peppercorn (ground for intense flavor, whole for milder flavor). Saute for 30 seconds.
                6. Then pour soya sauce.7. Next add red chilli paste or fermented chilli bean paste, vinegar, salt and sugar.
                8. Saute for a minute and then pour 3 to 4 tbsps water or oil.9. Mix and let the sauces bubble. The sauce will thicken slightly. Taste the sauce and add more chili paste, sugar etc to suit your taste. Ensure the sauce is tasting like you want it, then proceed further. You can also add more water if the sauce turns too thick.
                10. Add fried chicken and toss well in the sauce for 1 minute until the sauce coats the chicken well.11. Then add ground pepper (powder) and green onions.
                Serve szechuan chicken hot as a appetizer or side with fried rice or noodles. It is best served hot asthe crisp fried chicken begin to soften when it cools down.</p>
