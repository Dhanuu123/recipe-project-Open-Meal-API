            <p class="pro">1. Bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Add ¼ teaspoon salt to the water.2. Add 150 to 200 grams noodles. No need to break them. Here I have used hakka noodles. But you can use whole wheat noodles, soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) or chowmein noodles or ramen noodles.3. Cook the noodles according to package directions.4. Allow the noodles to cook until tender and softened. You don’t need to cook the noodles al dente as later we only toss the noodles with the stir-fried veggies and do not cook them further. But if you prefer, you can cook them until al dente.5. Drain the cooked noodles in a colander.6.  Rinse the noodles very well under running water to stop the cooking process.7. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame oil to the noodles. You can also use any neutral-flavored oil.            
                8. Toss them well so that the oil gets coated evenly on the noodles to prevent them from sticking together. Cover and keep the noodles aside.9. While the noodles are cooking, chop and grate the veggies. Also chop the button mushrooms. Set aside.10. Prepare cornflour (aka cornstarch) slurry with 2 teaspoons cornflour and 2 tablespoons water. Keep aside.
