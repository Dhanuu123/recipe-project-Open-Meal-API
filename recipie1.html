            <p class="pro">1. First prepare marinade with hung curd or greek yogurt. Add it to a mixing bowl along with lemon juice, ginger garlic paste, turmeric, chilli powder, salt, oil and garam masala.
                You can refer this post to make hung curd. I have used this garam masala and olive oil.
                You can use any oil including sesame oil.
                My ginger garlic paste has turmeric in it, so I did not add any more. I prefer to use onion for most grilled foods as they lend a unique aroma when they are charred.
                2. Add boneless chicken as well to a bowl. Make sure there is no water. Excess moisture either in the chicken or yogurt is going to drip off from the chicken. So this doesn't make chicken kebab so good.
3. Marinate the chicken with the prepared marinade. Add the onions as well.
4. Next marinate and refrigerate over night or least for 4 hours. The longer they soak up in the marinade the more tender and delicious they taste.</p>
