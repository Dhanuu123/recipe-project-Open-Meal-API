            <p class="pro">Cut chicken thigh or breast to 1 to 1 ½ inch pieces and add them to a mixing bowl. For this recipe I used about 500 grams boneless chicken breast. You can also use thigh if that is your choice. Make sure there is no excess moisture (water) in your chicken. You may want to pat dry with a few kitchen tissues.
                Add the following spices and herbs
                1 teaspoon salt (I use pink salt, you may reduce or increase according to the kind of salt you have)
                ½ to 2 teaspoons Kashmiri Red chilli powder (To make it less spicy use ½ teaspoon)
                ¼ teaspoon turmeric
                ¾ teaspoon roasted cumin powder (roasted ground cumin)
                2 teaspoons coriander powder (ground coriander)
                1 to 1 ¼ teaspoon garam masala
                1 teaspoon chaat masala (skip if you don't have or 1/3 teaspoon amchur, dried mango powder)
                ½ teaspoon black pepper crushed
                Add 1 tablespoon kasuri methi and 1 tablespoon lemon juice (skip lemon if your yogurt is even slightly sour)
                Mix together and rest for at least 10 to 15 mins. If you are in a rush you may carry on with the next steps.</p>
